        faithful born-again, Bible-believing Christians! Discover what the

        and how overcomers are covered with glory in the heavenly realms!

        They were written as a response to the social and theological
        contexts created by the heretical Prosperity Gospel. They are also
        a response to liberal theology which scorns the whole idea of
        heavenly rewards and inheritances as philosophically naive.
        However, rewards and inheritances are clearly taught by Jesus and
        the apostles and prophets from Genesis to Revelation!

        being persecuted all over the world especially in places such as
        Nigeria and Pakistan. Christians all over the world will need to
        understand their heavenly rewards and inheritance in order to
        remain steadfast and immovable in the Lord:

        <strong>1 Corinthians 15:57–58</strong><br>
        <em>
          But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord
          Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast,
          immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that
          in the Lord your labor is not in vain.
